URL Pull

## Short Description

Copy or download tab titles and URLs from the current tab, current window, or all windows.

## Detailed Description

URL Pull helps collect browser tab titles and URLs into a clean text export.

Choose the current tab, current window, or all open browser windows. Multi-window exports are grouped by browser window. Add optional saved context text to the top of each export, then copy the result or download it as Markdown or JSON.

Filters are enabled by default for Google Search tabs, non-http(s) pages, and duplicate URLs.

URL Pull runs locally in the browser. It does not send tab data or saved context text to any server.
